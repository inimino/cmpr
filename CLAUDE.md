Guidance to Claude Code.


## Overview

cmpr provides code block database features.

**cmpr1 vs cmpr2**: This is the cmpr1 codebase (C implementation). The parent directory contains cmpr2 (Python implementation), which is more feature-complete. Some documentation references blocks that exist in cmpr2 but not yet in cmpr1 (e.g., #agent_framework, #agent_implementation_pattern). These represent implementation goals. See #cmpr2_via_cmpr1 for accessing cmpr2 blocks.

## Building and Testing

```bash
# Production build
make

# Install
sudo make install

# Run the installed binary
cmpr

# Run the build that `make` generates without installing it
dist/cmpr
```

See #help for the cmpr --help output.

See #makefile for further details.

## Code Updates

**MANDATORY FIRST STEP FOR EVERY TASK**:

When the user asks you to work on ANY task related to this codebase, you MUST:

1. **START by reading the root block**: `cmpr --print-comment '#root'`
2. **NAVIGATE using block references**: Follow block IDs mentioned in the output (2-3 hops to reach any part of codebase)
3. **NEVER use the Task tool with Explore subagent** - it uses traditional tools and defeats the entire cmpr workflow
4. **NEVER start with grep/find/Read/Glob** - these are fallbacks for when cmpr navigation fails

**Example of CORRECT workflow**:
```
User: "I want to work on the agent system"
Assistant: [Immediately runs] cmpr --print-comment '#root'  # Read the root block
Assistant: [Sees reference to agent blocks, follows them] cmpr --print-comment '#root_agent'
Assistant: [Now understands the structure and can navigate to specific agent blocks]
```

**Example of WRONG workflow**:
```
User: "I want to work on the agent system"
Assistant: [Uses Task tool with Explore subagent] ❌ WRONG
Assistant: [Uses grep to search for "agent"] ❌ WRONG
Assistant: [Uses Glob to find agent files] ❌ WRONG
```

**Always prefer cmpr commands over traditional text tools** (grep, sed, cat, etc.) when working with the cmpr codebase.

**Why use cmpr commands**:
- They understand the block structure
- They are way more efficient, because you can get directly from the root block to any other block in the codebase in ~ log n steps

**Navigation Commands**:
- `cmpr --print-block '#id'` - Show entire block (NL + PL)
- `cmpr --print-comment '#id'` - Show only NL comment
- `cmpr --print-code '#id'` - Show only PL code
- `cmpr --grep 'pattern'` - Search for pattern across blocks (PREFER THIS for searching)
- `cmpr --find-block 'search_term'` - Find blocks containing text (deprecated, use --grep instead)
- `cmpr --files-blocks` - Overview of all blocks in the project

**List blocks in a specific file**:
```bash
cmpr --files-blocks | grep -A 1000 'file: rvs_lib.py' | grep -B 1000 -m 1 '^file:' | head -n -1
```

This grep pipeline extracts just the blocks for a specific file from the `--files-blocks` output.

**Editing Commands**:
- `cmpr --replace '#id'` - Replace entire block (NL + PL) from stdin; for blocks with no PL part, this effectively replaces just the NL
- `cmpr --replace-comment '#id'` - Replace only NL part
- `cmpr --replace-code '#id'` - Replace only PL part (rarely used; prefer --rewritepl)
- `cmpr --after '#id'` - Add a new block after the given block ID, reading contents from stdin

There should be --before but there isn't.
This is annoying when you want to make a new block be the first one in a file.
The workaround is: cat the new block then the current first block of the file separated by a newline, into --replace <id of first block>.

**INBOX Pattern for Staging New Blocks**:

The #INBOX block serves as a staging area for new blocks during development:

```bash
# Add a new block after INBOX
<something> | cmpr --after '#INBOX'
# Check the INBOX
cmpr --files-blocks | grep -A 1000 'file: INBOX.c' | grep -B 1000 -m 1 '^file:' | head -n -1
```

This pattern:
- Provides a known location for rapid iteration without deciding final placement
- Keeps new work (experience reports, experiments) organized
- Blocks in INBOX should be moved to appropriate locations during review sessions
- Use the block moving pattern (save, delete, insert) to relocate staged blocks

When to use INBOX:
- Experience reports documenting work sessions
- Experimental or exploratory blocks
- New documentation blocks whose final home is unclear
- Any block where you want to defer the navigation structure decision

## Reordering/Moving Blocks

**Adding a block at the START of a file** (no --before exists yet):
```bash
# Create new content with overview block, then concat existing first block, then replace
cat new_block.txt <(cmpr --print-block '#first_block_id') | cmpr --replace '#first_block_id'
```

To move a block to a different position in a file:

1. Save the block to a temp file: `cmpr --print-block '#block_id' > /tmp/block.txt`
2. Delete the block from its current position: `echo "" | cmpr --replace '#block_id'`
3. Insert it at the new position: `cat /tmp/block.txt | cmpr --after '#target_block_id'`

**IMPORTANT**: Never create temporary duplicates of blocks (adding before deleting) because having duplicate block IDs results in undefined behavior. Always delete first, then add at the new location.

**Example - Moving #events_types before #ui_state**:
```bash
# Step 1: Save block
cmpr --print-block '#events_types' > /tmp/events_types.txt

# Step 2: Delete from current location
echo "" | cmpr --replace '#events_types'

# Step 3: Insert at new location (after the block that should precede it)
cat /tmp/events_types.txt | cmpr --after '#rev_info'
```

**Navigating the Codebase**:

All navigation MUST start from the root block and follow block references:

1. **Start at the root block**: Read it with `cmpr --print-comment` to see the main navigation hubs
2. **Use 2-3 hops**: You should be able to reach any area of the codebase in 2-3 `--print-comment` calls by following block references

**Example Navigation Paths**:

To add a CLI feature to cmpr.c (like --grep):
- Start at the root block → find references to argument handling → navigate to `#argtable` → then `#handle_args` (dispatching)
- From there, look at similar implementations to understand the pattern

To understand the agent/want/decision system:
- `#root` → `#root_agent` → #root_agent_check, #root_agent_fix (executable agents)
- Follow references to implementation, design, and integration blocks

To work on the event system:
- `#root` → `#cmpr_events` → #events_types, #events_functions (implementation)
- Follow references to tests (#test_events_proposal) and integration docs

**Rule**: If you cannot reach the blocks you need from the root block by following direct references, that is a PROBLEM. DO NOT work around it by using search commands. Instead:
1. STOP and inform the user that navigation is broken
2. Help fix the navigation structure by adding appropriate overview blocks or references
3. Only proceed with the original task after navigation is fixed
4. If the only thing you do is fix the navigation, so that you can find what you need to in 2-3 hops from root, and then you end the session and the programmer commits your change, that was a good session.

### NL/PL Synchronization

**Standard Workflow** (use this for all changes):
1. Edit ONLY the NL using `cmpr --replace-comment '#blockid'` which takes new contents on stdin.
   - you should always have the previous NL in scope, otherwise do a --print-comment first, then make your changes
2. Run `cmpr --rewritepl '#block_id'` to regenerate PL from NL
3. Run `cmpr --print-code '#block_id'` to verify the generated PL looks correct
4. Test the changes with `dist/cmpr`

**When to Manually Maintain PL**:
- Only mark a block as "Manually maintained" if you MUST write PL directly
- Add "Manually maintained." as the last line of the NL comment
- This is rare and should be avoided when possible - prefer letting the system generate code

**CRITICAL: NL Precision for nl2pl**:
- The nl2pl system can generate correct code, but ONLY when the NL is unambiguous
- Vague specifications lead to incorrect implementations
- When performance or correctness matter, be VERY explicit about:
  - Exact algorithms (e.g., "BFS traversal calling cmpr --print-comment for each block")
  - Data structures (e.g., "block-scoped graph, not file-scoped")
  - What NOT to do (e.g., "don't scan entire files, only individual NL comments")
- If the generated PL is wrong, the NL was probably ambiguous - fix the NL, not the PL

**Important Notes**:
- The `cmpr` command in PATH reads the current source files (for inspecting)
- The `dist/cmpr` binary is the built executable (for testing)
- The interactive `r` command in the TUI does the same as `--rewritepl`

### Testing Changes

**Build System**:
- Run `make` to build `dist/cmpr`
- Check build timestamp: `dist/cmpr --version`
- The Makefile will compile changed source files and link the binary

**Testing Binary**:
- Always test with `dist/cmpr`, not the system `cmpr` command
- The system `cmpr` at `/usr/local/bin/cmpr` will be older
- After code changes, run `make` to rebuild before testing

### Code Conventions

It should be possible to reach any block by following "Justifies: " lines, or explicit blockid mentions, starting from the root block.

**Important Note**:
We are still building up the graph from the root block to all the other blocks.
If you cannot reach the blocks that you need from the root block by following direct references, that's a problem.
DO NOT work around it but always stop and make some edits.

The basic idea is this:
The root block should give a high-level overview of the parts of the project.
If you know what you're trying to do (e.g. add feature X) then you should be able to determine where the relevant code is by just following blockids and using --print-comment 2-3 times, which makes things very efficient.
When that's not the case, you should probably ask the programmer about what needs to be improved in the structure, because we're still building this system out.

Similarly, if a cmpr command doesn't work or doesn't do what you expect, don't fall back to using other tools, but always let the programmer know and we'll fix it together.
We're using cmpr to build cmpr itself here, so if cmpr doesn't work right, then we always fix that before continuing with whatever we were doing before.

### Project Configuration
- Configuration is stored in `.cmpr/conf`
- Bootstrap scripts provide AI context: `./bootstrap.sh` -- this is obsolete
- Default model and build commands are configurable per project

## Core Architecture

### Single-Tier C System
This is a pure C application with no web frontend or HTTP server:
- **`cmpr.c`** - Main application: block database, CLI commands, and terminal UI (TUI)
- **`spanio.c`** - Custom I/O library using span-based string handling
- **`prompt_templates.c`** - LLM prompt templates for nl2pl code generation

### Block-Based Code Organization
- Code is organized into discrete "blocks" with IDs like `#block_name`
- Each block contains:
  - **NL Part**: Natural language comment (source of truth)
  - **PL Part**: Programming language code (generated from NL)
- Block references (`@other_block`) provide context dependencies
- Transitive references create dependency graphs

### Revision System
- Every code change is automatically versioned in `.cmpr/revs/`
- Uses SipHash checksums for content integrity
- Complete history tracking with timestamps
- There is an 'rvs' command which lets us interact with the revisions; we'll expand this section later; it's not very useful yet.

## Key Components

### cmpr.c (Main Application)
- **CLI Mode**: Command-line interface with flags like `--grep`, `--print-block`, `--replace`, etc.
- **Terminal UI (TUI)**: Interactive mode with single-keystroke commands (`j/k/g/G` for navigation, `r` for rewrite, `B` for build)
- **Block Database**: Parses and manages blocks across all source files
- **Operations**: Block navigation, code generation (nl2pl), building, search, history
- **LLM Integration**: Calls external LLM APIs for nl2pl code generation

### spanio.c (I/O Library)
- Custom I/O library using span-based string handling with `.buf` and `.end` pointers
- Arena allocation avoiding malloc overhead
- Efficient string operations without null-terminator dependencies

### prompt_templates.c
- LLM prompt templates for nl2pl (natural language to programming language) conversion
- System prompts and few-shot examples for code generation

## Development Patterns

### Natural Language Programming Workflow
1. Write English descriptions in block comments
2. AI converts to working code in target language
3. System maintains consistency between documentation and code
4. Focus on higher-level architectural decisions

### Agent System and Decision Tracking

**Agent Architecture** (see #agent_framework for details):
- An agent = **Predicate (Want)** + **Step Function (CHECK/FIX)**
- Wants establish event spaces: {desired state, complement}
- Agents verify and maintain wants through CHECK and FIX modes

**Four Decision States** (tracked → checked → assisted → owned):
1. **Tracked**: We record the want but don't verify it
2. **Checked**: We can determine if criteria is met
3. **Assisted**: We can offer help with fixing it
4. **Owned**: We automatically maintain the want

**Implementing Agents** (see #agent_implementation_pattern in cmpr2; #root_agent_check and #root_agent_fix for cmpr1 examples):
- Create two blocks: predicate block + step function block
- Both executable via `cmpr --print-code '#blockid' | sh` or `bash`
- Step functions report state using SN notation
- Example in cmpr1: `#root` (predicate) + `#root_agent_check` (CHECK mode) + `#root_agent_fix` (FIX mode)
- Agents integrate with the event system (T) to record activity - see #claude_experience_report_root_agent_t_integration_20251227

**SN Notation** for confidence levels:
- 255 bits = definitional (statement is defined to be true)
- 20 bits = ~1 million to 1 confidence (virtually certain)
- 0 bits = describes possible event with no support

### Event System (T/E/S)

The event system provides temporal reasoning capabilities through tracking events in "transient memory" (T).

**Key Concepts**:
- **T (transient memory)**: Current event state, automatically persisted to `.cmpr/T`
- **E (events)**: Individual event strings with associated strength values
- **S (strength)**: Binary log odds representing bits of support for a proposition
- **SN lines**: Format is `"event_string" <strength>.` where interior quotes are NOT escaped

**CLI Commands**:
- `cmpr --T0` - Reset T to empty state
- `cmpr --event "string" --strength 255` - Add event to T (currently only strength 255 supported)
- `cmpr --T` - Print current T state as SN lines
- `cmpr --memorize` - Save timestamped snapshot of T to `.cmpr/events/`
- `cmpr --recall` - Search snapshots using current T as query, load matching snapshot with full context

**Implementation Details**:
- T persists automatically to `.cmpr/T` on every change
- Events are loaded on startup and saved after modifications
- Memorize creates timestamped snapshots (YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-nanos format)
- Recall searches snapshots (newest first) for ones containing any query event from current T, then loads all events from the matching snapshot
- Event strings can contain any characters including quotes (per SN spec)
- Duplicate events update strength rather than creating duplicates

**SN Format Specification**:
Per the SN notation convention:
- SN lines begin with `"` and end with `" <digits>.`
- Interior double quotes are NOT escaped
- Parse by finding `" <digits>.` pattern at end of line
- Everything between opening `"` and final `" <digits>.` is the event string

## File Structure

- **Core Application**: `cmpr.c` (main application with CLI and TUI)
- **I/O Library**: `spanio.c` (span-based string handling)
- **Prompt Templates**: `prompt_templates.c` (LLM prompts for nl2pl)
- **Staging Area**: `INBOX.c` (staging area for new blocks)
- **Configuration**: `.cmpr/conf` (project configuration)
- **Build System**: `Makefile`
- **Revisions**: `.cmpr/revs/` (automatic versioning)
- **Build Output**: `dist/cmpr` (compiled binary)

## Common Pitfalls and Process Reminders

**CRITICAL: Always Use cmpr Commands**

After exiting planning mode or when context-switching, it's easy to forget cmpr commands exist and fall back to traditional file editing (Write, Edit tools). This makes you 10x slower and less token-efficient.

**Before touching ANY file**:
1. Check if it's block-managed: `cmpr --files-blocks | grep filename`
2. If yes, use ONLY cmpr commands: `--print-comment`, `--replace`, `--after`
3. NEVER use Write/Edit tools on block-managed files

**Common mistakes**:
- ❌ Using Task tool with Explore subagent to "explore the codebase" → ✅ Start at root block and navigate
- ❌ Using `Write` to create new blocks → ✅ Use `cmpr --after <block_id>`
- ❌ Using `Edit` to modify existing blocks → ✅ Use `cmpr --replace '#block_id'`
- ❌ Using `Read` + manual parsing → ✅ Use `cmpr --print-comment '#block_id'`
- ❌ Using `grep`/`find` to locate code → ✅ Use `cmpr --grep` or navigate from root
- ❌ Manually reading .cmpr/revs files → ✅ Use existing rvs indices and helpers
- ❌ Starting ANY task without reading root block first → ✅ Always start by reading the root block to see navigation hubs
- ❌ Piping commands into `--replace-code` without testing → ✅ Test with `wc -l`, then `grep`, THEN replace
- ❌ Grepping or filtering `make` output → ✅ Read it directly - it's a serious build system, not npm
- ❌ Creating blocks without knowing final location → ✅ Use `cmpr --after '#INBOX'` and move later

**Block structure patterns**:
- ❌ One block containing multiple function implementations → ✅ Overview block listing child blocks
- Each block should either be:
  - An overview/index block (NL only, listing other blocks)
  - A single implementation block (NL + PL for one function/feature)
- When you see a block with many functions, refactor it into an overview + individual blocks
- Don't be afraid to refactor a block into two new blocks.
  When you do this: make the first block the right size and the second block contain everything else.
  If it can't be divided up that way, don't refactor it.
  Use the _2 prefix for the second block unless there's clearly something better to call it (like draw_the_rest_of_the_fucking_owl).
  When you do that, don't change anything else, and wrap up the session and commit the change soon if you can.

**When working with existing infrastructure**:
- DON'T reimplement helpers that already exist (like checksum functions)
- DO navigate from root block to find existing functionality
- DO check #rvs_index_catalog before designing new indices
- DO look at similar command blocks for patterns (e.g., #rvs_history for new rvs commands)

Never be afraid to go back to the root block and look for something else.

**Plan mode amnesia**:
- Planning mode can last multiple turns - easy to forget the cmpr workflow
- When exiting plan mode, IMMEDIATELY verify: "Am I working with block-managed files?"
- Refresh memory of cmpr commands before starting implementation

## Experience Reports

- Don't continue debugging endlessly - know when to stop
- Write an experience report block documenting what was accomplished and what's broken
- User can pick up debugging in next session with full context
- Experience report blocks follow naming pattern: `#claude_experience_report_TOPIC_YYYYMMDD_N` or substitute other agent name for "claude" here, e.g. "codex", or others.
